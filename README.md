# 👋 Hi, I'm Claire

### Customer Experience & Insight Analyst  
*Behaviour • Communication • Data • Patterns*

I connect customer signals with data to understand behaviour, identify friction, and improve journeys.  
My background spans more than a decade across CX, communication and lifecycle roles, and I recently expanded my analytical toolkit through a Data Science & AI bootcamp (Python, SQL, ML, NLP).

I use structured thinking, behavioural insight and analytical methods to translate complex patterns into clear, actionable recommendations.
